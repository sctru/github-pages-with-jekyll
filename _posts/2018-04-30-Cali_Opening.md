Writing about the journey to eco friendly practices. Starting with a home in the Orange County, California area.
Hoping the writing process helps to distill a little wisdom from my experiences on this path.

1. Consumer packaging - lots of plastic waste.
1. Recycling - community recycling. Included with our municipal trash disposal. Handles cardboard, plastics, aluminum, and glass.
1. Composting - Our trash disposal includes green waste disposal. However, I'm starting up a compost bin for vege and fruit scraps. At the moment, just a 30 gal. trash can with a lid. Alternating dry layers (leaves, sawdust, etc.) with food scrap layers.
1. Energy parity - LED lightbulbs... considering tesla Powerwall and solar roof tiles =D.
